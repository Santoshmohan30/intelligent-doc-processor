# Intelligent Document Processor – Technical Overview

## 1. Project Purpose

The Intelligent Document Processor is a backend system designed to:

- Accept document uploads (PDF, PNG, JPG)
- Extract text using OCR (Tesseract)
- Store extracted data in a database
- Return structured JSON responses via API

This project demonstrates backend architecture, API design, file handling, database persistence, and structured engineering practices.

---

## 2. System Flow (End-to-End Pipeline)

### Step 1 – User Upload
A client uploads a document through:

POST /api/v1/documents/upload

The request is received by the FastAPI backend.

---

### Step 2 – API Layer
FastAPI validates the request and forwards the file to the OCR service.

The API is responsible for:
- Request validation
- Routing
- Returning structured responses

---

### Step 3 – OCR Processing (Tesseract)

Tesseract OCR:
- Analyzes image pixels
- Recognizes characters
- Converts image data into readable text

The extracted text is returned to the backend service layer.

---

### Step 4 – Database Storage

The system stores:
- filename
- file size
- file type
- extracted text
- processing time
- timestamps
- status

SQLite is used as the database.
SQLAlchemy is used as the ORM layer.

---

### Step 5 – JSON Response

The API returns:

{
  "message": "Document processed successfully",
  "document": {
    "id": 1,
    "filename": "example.png",
    "extracted_text": "...",
    "status": "completed"
  }
}

This ensures structured communication between backend and client.

## 3. Folder Structure Explanation

### backend/
Contains the core application logic.

- api/ → Defines endpoints (routes)
- services/ → Business logic (OCR processing)
- database/ → Data models and DB setup
- main.py → Application entry point

---

### docs/
Contains documentation and system explanation files.

---

### tests/
Contains unit and integration tests.

---

### infrastructure/
Reserved for Docker, monitoring, deployment configurations.

---

## 4. Key Technologies Used

- Python 3.11
- FastAPI (API framework)
- Uvicorn (ASGI server)
- Tesseract OCR
- SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- SQLite (Database)
- Pytest (Testing)
- Git & GitHub (Version control)

---

## 5. Why This Architecture Matters

This project follows separation of concerns:

- API layer handles communication
- Service layer handles logic
- Database layer handles persistence

This modular structure makes the system:
- Maintainable
- Testable
- Scalable
- Production-ready

---

## 6. Engineering Practices Demonstrated

- Virtual environment isolation
- Dependency freezing (requirements.txt)
- Git-based version control
- Structured commits
- Clean folder organization
- Documentation-driven development

---

## 7. Future Improvements

- Add document classification model
- Add entity extraction (dates, totals)
- Add asynchronous background processing
- Add frontend UI
- Add Docker deployment

---

## Conclusion

The Intelligent Document Processor demonstrates a complete backend document-processing pipeline using professional software engineering practices.

It reflects understanding of:
- API architecture
- File handling
- OCR integration
- Database modeling
- Modular code design
- Deployment structure
